## Overview
This web application was created to assist real estate investors in making informed buying decisions. As a real estate investor myself, I understand the importance of accurately calculating expenses and projected income in order to determine the potential cash flow and return on investment.

With this application, users can enter key details such as purchase price, mortgage details, projected income and expenses. The app will then calculate projected cash flow and cash on cash return, helping investors to evaluate the potential profitability of their investment.
## How to use?
To use the application, simply follow the link to the [REI Calculator](https://kzolea695.shinyapps.io/REI_Calculator/) and input your desired investment information. The app will automatically calculate your projected cash flow and return on investment.
## Future work
In the future, I plan to add more calculations to the application to provide users with even more insights and decision-making support. I am also considering the addition of a report generation feature to allow users to easily share their calculations with others.

Thank you for using the Real Estate Investment Calculator, and happy investing!
